Q-1: What is event Loop?
Ans: Event loop is a mechanism in JS which is used to handle async operaions. Insted of blocking the whole porgram while waiting for the longer tasks like reading the file or DB queries, Nodejs uses event loop to handle them on background while continue executing the other parts of the code. This makes JS efficient & non-blocking.

- Event checks if the CallStack is empty, if so it picks the tasks from CallBack Queue or Priority Queue and place them in CallStack.

- CallStack: CallStack is a collection of functions which are currently under execution if not function then Global Anonymous Function will be there. Micro task queue will have more priority then that of CallBack Queue.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-2: What is process.NextTick(), setImmediate() & setTimeout()?
Ans: 
- process.NextTick(): process.NextTick() runs immediately after the current function finishes it;'s execution, before anything else(Timers & I/O).
- setImmediate(): setImmediate() runs after the current I/O event completes, in the next round of the event loop.
- setTimeout(): setTimeout() runs after specified delay.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-3: What is Promise? What is Promise.all() & Promise.allSettled()?
Ans: Promise is an object, Promise reprents future results of an async operations. We have 3 states in promise:-
- pending, fullfilled, rejected.
- Promise.all(): resolves when all the promises succeed, rejects if any failed. (used to handle multiple API's at same time.)
- Promise.allSettled(): resolves when all the promises are settled, regardless of success & failure.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-4: What are Streams?
Ans: Streams are object in JS that are used to read & write the data piece by piece in chunks instead of loading them all into the memory at once it improve the performance for large files. Reading large CSV files & for uploading files on AWS s3.
-Buffer is a store in memory which is used to store raw data files like images, files or network data. So that nodejs can process it efficiently, especially when data arrives in Chunks.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-5: What is Middleware?
Ans: Middleware in expressJs is a function that runs before the request reaches to the controller. It is used for Authentication, Error handling, Logs etc.

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("Req: ", req);
    next();
})
====================================================================================================================================
Q-6: What is app.use() & app.get()?
Ans:
-app.use(): app.use() is used to handle all the HTTP methods and use for applying middlewares also.
-app.get(): app.get() is used to handle only GET requset for specific routes.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-7: How do you handle Global Error?
Ans: By using 4 params in middleware:

- app.use((req, res, next, err) => {
    res.status(errCode).json({ message: err.message });
})
====================================================================================================================================
Q-8: What is Rate Limiting? How you handle Rate Limiting and RBAC?
Ans: Rate limiting is a technique use to control the number of API requet client can make in a given time period.
Using express-rate-limiter && RBAC using custom middleware that check user role before accessing the routes.

Q-23: What is PUT & PATCH?
Ans: PUT -> update the entire data | PATCH -> update the required data.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-24: What is Access and refresh Token?
Ans:
- accessToken: The access token is a short-lived token used to access protected routes or APIs.It is sent with every API request in the headers (usually as a Bearer token) to verify user identity        
- refreshToken:The refresh token is a long-lived token used to obtain a new access token when the old one expires.It is not sent with every API request, usually stored securely in HttpOnly cookies, and helps avoid forcing the user to log in again.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-25: How do you store tokens securely on the client side?
Ans:HttpOnly cookie to avoid xss attack (accesstoken) db (refreshtoken)
====================================================================================================================================
Q-26: How do you handle errors from DB or async operations?
Ans: Using try...catch block also I use winston to log errors and to hide it from the client.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-27: How do you handle a slow third-party API?
Ans: If the 3rd party API is getting slow I use:
- Timeout.
- Retry logic.
- Fallback or Error Handling.
- Caching if data is static.
- Proper logging and Monitoring.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-28: What would you do if your app starts throwing 500 errors in production?
Ans: 
- I will check the logs given by Winston trying to get & understand the stack trace errors.
- I will copy the cURL from production and check in my local or dev.
- I will check for dependencies.
- I will Rollback to previous commit or deployment if possible.
- If rollback isn't possible, I will go for Hotfix.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-29: What is Shallow & Deep copy?
Ans:
- Shallow copy means top level property will get copied also, if I'll make any changes in the copied object it will get update in the original object.
- Deep copy means copying all the property using JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)), & if I'll make any in the copied object it will not reflect on original object.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-30: What is Session Based Authentication & Token Based Authentication?
Ans:
1. SBA: In SBA the server will store the login information and share the cookie with the client to stay logged in.
2. TBA: In TBA the server will not store anything instead it will give one token that client after login, and the client must send that token with every request.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-31: What is JWT Commonly used?
Ans: JWT is commonly used as it is stateless(doesn't store in session info), self-contained(all info of the user) and easy to validate on the server making it scalable for distributed system.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-32: How you secure sensitive data in API?
Ans:
- Using HTTPS
- Input validation and Sanitization (Is the data correct? & Make the data safe)
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Secure headers
- Rate Limiting / Throtling
- Data Encryption 
====================================================================================================================================
Q-33: CI/CD??
Ans: CI/CD is the process where your code is automatically tested, build and deployed so that developers can push there changes faster and safely.
.yml file under .github/workflows folder
- npm run install
- npm run lint or test
- npm run build
====================================================================================================================================
Q-34: What is Docker?
Ans: Docker is a tool that lets u package your app and everything that needs to be into a small unit called container so that it can run anywhere, fast, safely and consistently
====================================================================================================================================
Q-35: What happens if you don’t await an async function?
Ans: We will get a Promise we may get the result we may not.

- Can we use await without async? → Only at top-level in modules or special REPLs, otherwise no.

- Does async always return a Promise? → Yes, always.

- Is async/await a function or keyword? → They are keywords, not functions.

- Blocking? → No, it’s non-blocking to the main thread — only suspends that async function.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-36: What is Closure?
Ans:  A closure is a function that remembers the variables of it surrounding scope even if that scope has finished its execution.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-37: Why is Nodejs single threaded?
Ans: NodeJs is single threaded bcoz it uses an "Event Driven and Non-blocking" I/O model. This design helps them to handle many connections at the same time without creating a new thread for each one. This makes nodejs fast and efficient, especially for heavy I/O tasks like reading files, accessing DBs and calling APIs.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-38: Why did you choose microservices in your project?
Ans: We choose bcoz we have too many domains(Auth, Chat, Notification etc) and we want independent scaling & deployments.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-39: When we should avoid microservices?
Ans: When our requirement is small or when we have small teams or when we dont have enough resources for DevOps and network management. 
====================================================================================================================================
Q-40: How do services talk to each other?
Ans: Using REST (sync), message queues like Kafka/RabbitMQ(async) or gRPC for fast RPC-style communication.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-41: What is Expressjs?
Ans: ExpressJs is a leightweight nodejs web application framework that is used to develop APIs & web servers easily, also simplefies the routing, middlewares & req/res mgmt.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-42: How do you handle errors in ExpressJs?
Ans: 
- Using try...catch.
- Promise...catch.
- Error handling middlewares.
- try...catch using async await.
- Validaion npms.
- Process.on()
====================================================================================================================================
Q-43: Request & Response?
Ans: 
- Request: Request contains the data about HTTP request. (req.params, req.query, req.body)
- Response: Response is used to send back the data to the client. (res.send(),res.json())
====================================================================================================================================
Q-44: What is next() in middleware?
Ans: next() function is used in middleware to pass the controller to next middleware.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-45: What is NodeJs?
Ans: Nodejs is open source, cross platform javascript runtime environment that executes js code outside the browser, buit on Google v8 engine & it is design for builing fast, scalable & event-driven network applications.
====================================================================================================================================
Q-46: What is let,const & var?
Ans: 
- let: let is a keyword which is used to define variable whose value cannot be changes further.

- const: const is a keyword which is used to define variable whose value can be changed further.

- var: var is a keyword which is used to define variable whose value can be changes further, but it is not recommended it should be avoided to do so as it doesn’t respect the block scope. Var is a function scoped & that can cause unexpected bugs.

- It is allowed to initialize a variable without any value using let keyword (let a) bydefault it will store "undefined"

- It is also allowed to assign a value directly in a variable without using cont, let & var, it becomes "global variable" which is bad practise and can lead to bugs or memory issues.
====================================================================================================================================
47 Datatypes in JS?
Ans: Based on how we are storing & accessing datatypes are divided into two parts:
- Primitive & Non-Primitive.

- Primitive(Stack || Call by value): When a variable is stored in stack a copy of value is created, It means any changes to the copied value will not affect the original value.
- Number, BigInt, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol.

- Non- Primitive(Heap || call by reference): When a varibale is stored in Heap, the variable itself holds the reference (pointer) to the actual memory location where the value is created, It means any changes to the copied value will change the original value also.
- Object(Array, function etc)
====================================================================================================================================
48 What is Hoisting?
Ans:  Hoisting in JavaScript is the behavior where variable and function declarations appear to move to the top of their scope before the code runs. In reality, this happens during the memory creation phase of the JavaScript engine, where all variable and function declarations are stored in memory. Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized with undefined, so they can be accessed before their declaration but will return undefined. However, variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but not initialized, which means accessing them before their declaration will throw a ReferenceError because they exist in a “Temporal Dead Zone” (TDZ). Function declarations (defined with the function keyword) are fully hoisted, meaning both their name and body are stored in memory, allowing you to call them even before their definition in the code. In contrast, function expressions and arrow functions behave like variables—only the variable name is hoisted (with var as undefined), so calling them before their definition results in an error. This is why understanding hoisting helps avoid bugs and unexpected behavior in JavaScript code.
====================================================================================================================================
49 Undefined & Null?
Ans: Undefined: A variable is declared but not given (assigned) any value.
- Null: Intentionally setting or storing Null value to any variable.
====================================================================================================================================
50 What is cookie?
Ans: Cookie is a small piece of data stored in the browser by the website to remember information like login, user preference or traking data. It is automatically sent to ht server with every HTTP request.
====================================================================================================================================
51 Whahat is currying in JS?
Ans: Currying is a technique in JS where a function taking mutliple arguments can be transformed into the sequence of function, each taking one argument at a time.
====================================================================================================================================
52 What is IIFE?
Ans: IIFE is a function that immediately excutes after it is defined. It is typically used to create private scoping & avoid polluting the Global namespace.
====================================================================================================================================
53 What is clustering in JS?
Ans: Clustering in NodeJs means running mutliple instances(copies) of your Nodejs application simultaneously, this instances are called "Work process", they all share the same server and port number.
By default nodejs runs on a single CPU core, which can limit the performance. Clustering allows your app to utilize all the CPU cores, enabling it handle more users & concurrent request at the same time.

====================================================================================================================================
54 What is null?
Ans: Null in JS is not just a datatype but it is also a standalone value, it is used to represnt an empty value.
====================================================================================================================================
 55 What is undefined?
Ans: Undefined is when you defined a variable but didn't assign any value.
====================================================================================================================================
56 What are slice and splice methods?
Ans: 
- Slice: Slice method of an array excludes the last index value we passed as well it doesn't modify the original array.
- Splice: Splice method of an array includes the last index value we passed as well as it modifies the original array it pops out the gien range of elements from original array.
====================================================================================================================================
45. What is System Design?
Ans: System design is a process of designing the elements of the system like architecture, components and modules and the diferent interfaces of the components that goes 
through that system.

46. Types of System Design?
Ans: Two types we have: Low level design && High level design.

47. What is architecture?
Ans: Internal design details for building an application is called architecture.
======================================================================================================================================
48. What is Monolitihic Architecture?
Ans: A simple unified application that handle everything FE, BE & DB all together is called Monolithic Architecture || A cobination of FE, BE and DB written & deployed together is called Monolithic Architecture it is also called Centralized System.

Str: One codebase -> One deployment.

Pros: 
- Easy to understand.
- Easy to test, build & deploy.
- Less devOps complexity.
- Best for small size team & MVPs.

Cons:
- SPOF (Tight Coupling).
- Hard to scale.
- CI/CD is riskier as for small change also we need to do full redeployment.
======================================================================================================================================
49. What is Microservices?
Ans: Breaking the app into individual, loosley coupled services where each services has its own responsibility is called Microservices || Microservices are the collection of 
single individual services connected through the network that share common resources, communicate and co-ordinate to achieve common goals.

str: Each services have thier own DB, API & codebase.

Pros:
- We can scale the services independently.
- Faster deployment (we need to deploy only those services which have changes).
- Teams can work independently.
- No SPOF (Fault Tolerence) one bug cannot crash the whole app.
- Each services will have thier own DBs to ensure loose coupling.

Cons:
- Complex to manage the data sync, network, security etc.
- Requires DevOps, CI/CD Monitoring
- Communication overhead we required to make the communication happens between two systems.

======================================================================================================================================
50. What is Web Scokets?
Ans: Web Scoket is a protocol that allows persistent communication between client and server over a single TCP connection, its great for real time applications.

- We should use web sockets when we need real time updates and also when we need two way instant communication.
- We should avoid using web socket when we are dealing with CRUD operation also when scaling large number of open connections is a concern.

======================================================================================================================================
51. What is Message Queue?
Ans: To decouple services & handling async tasks like sending emails, notification & SMS and process uploads we use Message queues, Message queue is also use to handle spikes and failures, also it provides realibiity & scalability.
======================================================================================================================================
52. What is Circuit Braker?
Ans: Circuit Braker is used to detect the failure & cuts of the calls(repeated requests) to prevent overloading the services. After timeout it retries again.
======================================================================================================================================
53. What is API Gateway?
Ans: An API Gateway is an entry point for all the services it routes the requests to the right microservices enforcing security(JWT & CORS), centralizing logging & rate limiting.
======================================================================================================================================
54. What is DB Sharding?
Ans: Splitting the DB into parts based on key(like userId) is called DB Shard. When a single DB cannot handle the volume, we do DB sharding based on the key like (region & userId). 
Db sharding helps in performance and limits the DB overloads.
======================================================================================================================================
55 What is gRPC?
Ans: gRPC is high performance, open source (Remote Procedure Call) developed by google. gRPC allows different services to communicate with each other efficiently, especially useful in microservices architecture. gRPC uses HTTP2 || ProtoBuff.
======================================================================================================================================
56 What is BOM?
Ans: BOM stands for Browser Object Model, BOM allows javascript to interact with browser window.
ex: location.reload(), location.href(), history.forward(n), history.back(-n)
======================================================================================================================================
57 What is DOM?
Ans: Document Object Model
- DOM is a programming interface for web document(HTML, XML).
- DOM represents the page structure as tree of objects,where each elements, attributes and piece of text is a node.
- Using DOM, JS can access, modify, add or delete the elements.

- DOM is a programming interface for web document(HTML, XML).
- DOM represents the page str as tree of objects where each elements, attributes & piece of text is a node.
- Using DOM, JS can access, modify, add & delete the elements.
======================================================================================================================================
58 What is the diff between DOM & BOM?
Ans:
- DOM is about the page(content and structure), DOM is W3C standardized.
- BOM is about the browser(env & features), BOM is not standardized.
======================================================================================================================================
59 Elements Selectors?
Ans:
- getElementByTagName(): getElementByTagName() return HTML collection, if no data found it will return HTML collection[].

- getElementByClassName(): getElementByClassName() returns HTML collection, if no data found it will return HTML collection[]. To extract the first element we can use document.getElementByClassName('test')[0]

- getElementById(): getElementById() returns the first element with that ID, if not found it will return null, if multiple elements are present with that ID it will return the first element.

- querySelector(): querySelector() returns the first element that matches the selector, if not found it returns null.

- querySelectorAll(): querySelectorAll() returns the nodelist of all the elements that macthes the selector, if no element found it returns empty NodeList [].
======================================================================================================================================

- The differenece between HTML collection & Nodelist is, HTML collection dont have forEach loop where as Nodelist have forEach() loop. for loop we can use in both HTML collection & also in NodeList. We can convert the HTML collection into Array usig Array.form() and then we can use for loop.

- HTML collection is live, means it updates automatically when the document got updated, whereas Nodelist is static it doesnot automatically gets updated.

======================================================================================================================================
60 Difference between appendChild() & append()?
Ans:
- appendChild(): only Node, one at a time.
- append(): accepts both Node(s) & String(s), multiple allowed.
- append() function returns undefined, appendChild() returns the appended node.
- cloneNode(true) for full (deep) copy including text, cloneNode() || cloneNode(false) for shallow copy.
- Appending existing DOM node moves it, not copies it.
======================================================================================================================================
61 What is an Event?
Ans: It's a signal that tells that something(click, keypress, etc) has happended on the element.
======================================================================================================================================
62 What is Event Bubbling?
Ans: In event bubbling, the event starts from the target element and move upwards towards its ancestors.
======================================================================================================================================
63 What is Event Capturing?
Ans: In event capturing, the event starts from outermost ancestor and move downward to the target element.
======================================================================================================================================
64 What is e.stopPropogation()?
Ans: e.stopPropogation()  stops the event from propagating further (in both the case bubbling & capturing).
======================================================================================================================================
65 What is Event Delegation?
Ans: Event Delegation is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element to handle events from its child elements through event bubbling, making the code simpler and more efficient.
======================================================================================================================================
66 this keyword?
Ans: 'this' is a special keyword in JS that refers to the object which is currently executing the function. Its value is determined by how & where the function is called, not where it is defined. In normal function this is dynamic depends on caller, while in arrow function, this is lexically bound (inherited from where the function was executed).

-> Global(outside object / class): this = window (or undefined in strict mode) for both local & arrow function.
-> Object Method: this = object (in normal function), this = window (in arrow function).
-> Event Listener: this = element in normal function, this = window in arrow function.
-> Class Method: this = instance for both normal & arrow function.
======================================================================================================================================
67 What is REST?
Ans: Representational State Transfer
- Rest is leightweight, stateless way for applications to communicate over the web using HTTPs methods to access & manipulate the resources identified by URLs.
- stateless in REST means server doesnot store anything or any data about client, every request from client side must include all the information needed. (eg. token)
- leightweight in REST means, it uses JSON or XML not overheading heavy processess like SOAP.

PROS:
- Easy to understand & use.
- Clear meaning of operations.
- Widely Used.
- Easy to cache.

CONS:
- Not real time.
- Underfetching: doesnot return everything we need.
- Overfetching: returns too much data.

- We should use REST API when we need simple CRUD operation or when the system is stateless & not real time.
- We should not use REST APIs when we need real time update (chat socket apis, notification etc) or when we are sending nested and flexible data bcoz it might get over or under fetched.

- By default REST APIs will give fixed set of data if we want to control we can do it from BE side.
======================================================================================================================================
68 What is graphQL?
Ans: GraphQL is a query language for APIs that let the client ask what exactly they need nothing more, nothing less.

PROS:
- Single endpoint (/graphql)
- No versioning is required.
- Smart queries, searching & filtering (client ask exactly what they need).

CONS: 
- Harder to build, more code is required.
- File upload.
- Harder to cache.

- We should use graphQL when a FE need nested or customized data or when we want to reduce number of API calls.
- We should not use graphQL, when we need to upload file or when we need simple endpoints or when we have limited infra.
======================================================================================================================================
69 When would u use gRPC over REST?
Ans: We should use gRPC over REST when we need high performance, low latency & efficient communication between different microservices. REST is best for public browser facing APIs.
======================================================================================================================================
70 Why is gRPC faster then REST?
Ans: gRPC is fater then REST bcoz:
- HTTP2: HTTP2 allows multiple requests under a single connection.
- ProtoBuff: Protocall Buffer are compact binary format and smaller then JSON.
- buildIn streaming support.
======================================================================================================================================
71 What is Protocol Buffer?
Ans: Protocol Buffer Protobuff is a language neutral, platform neutral data serialization format developed by google. Protobuff turns the structured data into compact binary format, making the transmission fast & leightweight.
======================================================================================================================================
72 can gRPC support streaming?
Ans: Yes gRPC supports all four types of streaming, Uninary, Server side streaming, Client side streaming and Full duplex by-directional streaming all four over single HTTP connection.
======================================================================================================================================
73 Can gRPC be used in browser?
Ans: No, directly it can't be used in browser.
======================================================================================================================================
74 What are the limitations of gRPC when not to use it?
Ans: 
- Not natively supported in Browsers.
- Not ideal for simple public APIs.
- Harder to debug as it in compact binary format not in human readble format like JSON.
======================================================================================================================================
75 What is Throttling?
Ans: Throttling is a technique used to control the frequency of APIs requests by slowing them down or by spacing them out, instead of blocking them completely.
-> Rate Limiting: Restrict the number of requests.
-> Throttling: Control the speed of requests
